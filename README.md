# Welcome to Vanish!

Vanish is an app that lets you erase your data (Phone number only at the moment, update for WhatsApp messages, etc) from another person's phone. 
The app is completely safe to use within Google guidelines, and is capable of working if both phones have the app downloaded. It is a concept similar to TrueCaller-
in which both users require the app to use its functions, and in turn both have access to erasing their numbers off of the other's person's phone. 
NOTE: The app does not disclose nor store any information: Location, messages, contact list etc., IT SIMPLY JUST ERASES THE REQUESTED NUMBER IF FOUND ON THE USER'S 
PHONE.
